# laserTest
Generate GCode to generate CNC laser test cuts with differing speed, power, and focal distance settings.

An example of the output of this script is given in 'speedXpower.gcode'.
The inputs used to generate this output appear as comments at the top of the file.

A GCode simulator (e.g., https://nraynaud.github.io/webgcode/) can be used to see what is generated.
